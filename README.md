# UplayNameChecker

Tool to bulk-check username availability on Uplay. Made By VollRagm and Vpk

# Little backstory

I'm releasing a tool I built today. The reason behind this is, that it seems like a lot of people check if certain special usernames are available and then claim them.
I have posted the v1 version of this (Link removed as no longer avaible) using the r6tab API, but this API has been shut down. Since then people are messaging me, if I could update it. Due to the popularity of v1, me and Vpk have teamed up to create v2

# How to use (Compile first):

- Put the names to check in a names.txt in the same path as the exe (1 name on each line)
- Start the exe
- Available names will be written to availableNames.txt

If something doesn't work, let me know, maybe it can be fixed.

# Cheers for reading:

Many thanks from Vollragm and Vpk
